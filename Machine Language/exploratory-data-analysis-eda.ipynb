CONCLUSION:\n\n1. The dataset is about the students Performance in a school/College. There are 1000 observations and 8 variables in the dataset. The dataset has no missing values. Using the nunique() we get to know that most of the variables are categorical variables. Most of them are binary classification.\n\n2. A barchart is a simple diagram that is commonly used to represent the categorical variables. In this dataset the categorical variables are:\n\n    * Gender (binary classification)\n    * Race/Ethnicity (Multi class classification)\n    * parental level of education (Multi class classification) \n    * lunch (binary classification)                 \n    * test preparation course (binary classification)\n    \n\n3. A bar chart is plotted for all these categotical variables to know their composition. \n\n     * From __Fig1__, we see that out of 1000 students, 518 students are female and the remaining 482 students are male. \n     * From __Fig 2__ that represents the Race/Ethincity of the students, we observe that most of the students fall into group C category. The least number of students fall in group A. \n     * __Fig 3__ represents parents education level. Most of the parents have done gone to some college and few have got associate's degree. A very small proportion of parents have completed their masters. \n     * __Fig 4__ tells us about the lunch status of the students. The institution provides two types of lunch (ie)standard and free/reduced lunch. Clearly most of the students get standard type of lunch. \n     * __Fig5__ shows the test preparation course which is again classified into 2 types (ie) None and completed. Most of the students have not taken any test preparation course.\n     \n     \n4. Next we go for univariate analysis. The dataset has only 3 variables that are numerical. Those are:  \n\n     * Math_score\n     * Reading_score\n     * Writing score\n   \n   A boxplot represents 5 measures (ie) min,Q1,Q2(median),Q3 and max values and the same is represented by __Fig6__ . From the figure we see there are outliers but we won't remove them because it is possible for a student to score extremely low marks in a test. \n   \n   \n5. The __Fig7__ tells us the composition of girls and boys in each group. We already saw that most of the students fall into group C category. Within that group it is clear that most of them a female. Group A has more number of male.\n\n\n6.  __Fig8__ is a subplot that represent the performance analysis (ie) who scores better female or male. From the bar charts it is clear that male students are good in maths while female students are good in both reading and writing.  Also the table shows the mean scores for each subject with respect to the gender. From that table also it is clear that mean scores for females is slightly low in math_scores than male students. \n\n\n7. It is obvious that when a student does some course and completes it, the knowledge gained by them is more, which results in better performance during exams. Now we can thus say that most of of the male students have completed the course for maths and as a result the mean scores for maths was more for male students. The female students completed the course for reading and writing and hence they scored well (__Fig9__).\n\n\n8. The scoring pattern to an extent is also affected by parents education too. Clearly students who parents are well educated (ie) those parents who have done bachelors and masters, those studnets score in all the three exams were high(__Fig10__).\n\n\n9. One way to encourage students to come to school is by providing lunch for them. We already saw that lunch is being categorised into two parts (ie) standart and free. We also saw that most of the students are provided with standart lunch. Free lunch would be provided to those students who are economically poor.(Here it depends on which group the students belong to) __Fig11__ gives us a picture about the same and we can say that all the groupes are provided with standard lunch. The free lunch provided is more for female students(__Fig12__).\n\n\n10. 3 new columns were added to the dataset. The last column tells the grade each student belongs to. Most of the students belong to grade C (ie) their percentage lies between 35-55%. More number of female students belong to grade B.  We also wish to know that what type of lunch a student gets based on his grade (ie) we want to check if a student's grade is good then does he/she get free lunch. Clearly there is nothing like that(__Fig13__).","metadata":{}}]}
